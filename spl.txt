Splunk's inherent ability to monitor and track data loaded from ever growing log files, or accept data as it arrives on a port, are critical pieces of functionality.
	
The term latency, in regards to data, refers to the time it takes from data being captured to it being available for reporting any analysis.

Splunk is also excellent for dealing with sparse data. Much data in retailing environments is considered sparse. 

Splunk was invented as a way to keep track of and analyze machine data coming from a variety of computerized systems. 

Splunk's data capability is focused on machine data.
